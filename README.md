# Puto Order Management System

A web-based order management system developed for small family businesses, specifically designed to handle customer orders efficiently. Built using **Next.js**, this system helps manage orders, track payment statuses, and organize customer details with ease, using **IndexedDB** and **Service Workers** for local storage.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Add, update, and manage customer details including name, contact, and location.
- **Order Management**: Add new orders, select items, specify quantities, and calculate total amounts.
- **Order Status Tracking**: Track order statuses including Pending, Delivered, and Picked-up.
- **Payment Tracking**: Mark orders as Paid or Unpaid, with an option to revert the status.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Filter orders based on status, payment, and fulfillment method (Delivery/Pickup).
- **Item Selection**: Easily select products from a list, manage item quantities, and calculate the total order amount.
- **Dialog-Based UI**: Modal dialogs for adding new orders and managing existing ones.
- **User Interface**: User-friendly design with an intuitive and responsive layout.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for local storage, Service Workers for caching
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS components, Dialogs, Buttons, and Inputs

## Installation

To get started with the development of the Puto Order Management System, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

- [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes installed with Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/puto-order-management.git
Install dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:

After installing the dependencies, you can start the app locally:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Your app will be live at http://localhost:3000.

Service Worker Setup:

Service Workers are used for caching and enabling offline functionality. When you run the app, the service worker will automatically handle caching and background sync.

Usage
Once the app is running, navigate to the dashboard. You can:

Add new orders by clicking the "Add New Order" button.
Update order statuses and payment statuses.
Filter orders by their fulfillment method, payment status, and order status.
Manage items and quantities in each order.
Storage and Offline Functionality
IndexedDB is used to store orders and customer data locally on the user's device. This allows the app to function offline or in environments with intermittent internet connectivity.
Service Workers ensure that the app's assets (such as images, CSS, JavaScript) are cached for offline use. The app will continue to function smoothly even when there is no active internet connection.
Deployment
This app can be deployed on various platforms. A popular choice for Next.js apps is Vercel, which seamlessly integrates with Next.js.

To deploy on Vercel:
Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Sign in to Vercel and click on "New Project."
Connect your GitHub repository and follow the deployment steps.
Vercel will automatically deploy your project and provide a live URL for production.
